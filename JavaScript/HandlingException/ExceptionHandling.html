<!-- 
try: In this we will keep our logic in which we might face some exceptions
catch: This block will be executed when exception occurres in try block
finally: This block will always be executed irrespective of execption occurres or not.


Exception handling is required to avoid sudden termination in code
because of sudden terminations other instructions will remains unexecuted.

So, if we handle exception the further instructions will be executed
